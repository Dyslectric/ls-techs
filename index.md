# Technologies That I Use

## Project Management:
- Git: the only ubiquitous version control system

## Communication:
- Excalidraw: free, open source, and extremely easy to use diagram illustrator
- PlantUML: generate many different types of UML diagrams from text

## Build Systems:
- CMake: makes building your C++ application easy with any toolchain and on any
operating system

## Cloud Providers and Protocols:
Currently, I run all of my own services (which are only a few personal ones) on
my own hardware (a Dell Precision 7810). That is with the exception of this site
which is, clearly, on Github pages. I will add more to this section as I gain
knowledge in and experience with cloud systems.

## Operating System(s):
- Arch Linux: the quintessential rolling-release Linux distribution
- Proxmox Virtual Environment: an open-source type-one hypervisor built on top
of Debian Linux

## Text Editor(s):
- Visual Studio: fully-featured, cross-platform, free, open-source, most
widely-used text-editor
- Neovim: extremely minimalist and extensibile, cross-platform, free, and
open-source editor based on the ubiquitous editor, vim

## Package Repositories and Managers:
- Cargo: rust source package manager and build system, sources from crates.io
respository
- pip: de-facto standard python source package manager
- apt: likely the most widely-used linux binary package manager (used by Debian
and Ubuntu)
- MSYS2: pacman package-manager-based windows development packages repository
