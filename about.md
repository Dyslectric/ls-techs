# About Me
My name is David Green. I am a Computer Science student at Franciscan
University of Steubenville. I am 22 years old and have been programming for some
years; despite this, I have never built any kind of serious website before 2024.

This site will serve as a blog for my school projects and personal projects, as
well as for information that I feel can be useful to my fellow classmates and
especially my fellow lifelong learners.
